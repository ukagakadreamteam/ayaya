<p>This website is an English translation of the <a href="https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php">AYAYA wiki</a>, which is the official documentation for the coding language <a href="https://github.com/YAYA-shiori">YAYA</a>. <br />
The original wiki is written in Japanese, and this version aims to replicate it and its information as accurately as possible.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="jumpmenu"><a href="#navigator">&uarr;</a></div><h2 id="content_1_1">Translation project<a class="anchor_super" id="translation_project" href="#translation_project" style="user-select:none;">&dagger;</a></h2>
<p>This translation project is being attempted by members of the <a href="https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/info/ukagaka_dream_team">Ukagaka Dream Team</a> community. It is currently a work in progress, and many pages will still be in Japanese. <br />
If you are interested in contributing to the translation project, you can do so on the project's <a href="TODO">GitHub repository</a>. <br />
All help is appreciated, whether it's submitting better translations or pointing out areas where the translation is confusing or has typos. <br />
Note that a lot of mass processing has been done on the wiki's files, to clean out unneeded data, make things more readable, and convert links from Japanese into English. If you encounter links to other wiki pages that are broken, please report these so they can be fixed.
<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="jumpmenu"><a href="#navigator">&uarr;</a></div><h2 id="content_1_2">Editing the wiki<a class="anchor_super" id="editing_the_wiki" href="#editing_the_wiki" style="user-select:none;">&dagger;</a></h2>
<p>The original documentation is presented in a wiki format, and is editable by anyone. Unfortunately, it wasn't feasible to recreate that here. <br />
Instead, this documentation is provided as a static website, and will be updated manually when the original wiki updates. <br />
This also means that if you wish to edit the original documentation, to correct missing information, add example code, write a new tip, etc., you will need to do so on the original wiki, and then bring the changes to this version.</p>
<p><b>This translation reflects the original documentation, and will not add new additions or changes that are not present on the original version.</b> <br />
If you need to submit a correction to the original version, but you don't speak Japanese and don't know who to contact, get in touch with someone in the Ukagaka Dream Team and we can help out.
<br /></p>

<div class="jumpmenu"><a href="#navigator">&uarr;</a></div><h2 id="content_1_3">Differences from the original version<a class="anchor_super" id="differences_from_the_original_version" href="#differences_from_the_original_version" style="user-select:none;">&dagger;</a></h2>
<p>Because of the original version being in a wiki format and this version being a static website, there are some things that could not be brought to this version.<br />
<ul class="list1 list-indent1">
<li>Several links around the wiki will take you to the Japanese version instead, including the wiki message board, wiki help, and various non-image attachments.</li>
<li>Wiki-specific buttons, such as the toolbar and editing options, have been stripped out since they have no use here.</li>
<li>Note that some pages from the original wiki were not brought over, because they did not contain useful information, or only contained information about the wiki software itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from these changes, we are attempting to mimic the original site as closely as possible, including the content, styling, and overall format. <br />
If you find a page on the original wiki that is not replicated here, and you believe it should be, please submit an issue or pull request on the project's repository.
