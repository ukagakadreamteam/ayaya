# AYAYA
English translation of the [AYAYA wiki](https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php), the official documentation for the language [YAYA](https://github.com/YAYA-shiori).

As the original AYAYA is in wiki format, this project will be attempting to replicate its content on a static site, while preserving the general structure. It may behave a little differently from the original.

A rough priority order / checklist:

- manual/function/
- manual/error_handling_function/
- system_dictionary/
- manual/syntax/
- manual/basic/
- tutorial/
- startup/
- Files in the root directory
- old/
- tips/
