# AYAYA
English translation of the [AYAYA wiki](https://emily.shillest.net/ayaya/index.php), the official documentation for the language [YAYA](https://github.com/YAYA-shiori).

As the original AYAYA is in wiki format, this project will be attempting to replicate its content on a static site, while preserving the general structure. It may behave a little differently from the original.

Efforts will focus on the function pages first!
